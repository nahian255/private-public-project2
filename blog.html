            what is difference between arrow function
            and normal function?<br>
            Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their
            own this. The value of this inside an arrow function remains the
            same
            throughout the lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the
            value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function.

            What are template strings used for?<br>
            Template literals (template strings) allow you to use
            strings or embedded expressions in the form of a string. They
            are
            enclosed in backticks `` . For example, const name = 'Jack';
            console.
